Conceptual Questions

1. What is an Abstract Data Type?
   
   An ADT is a model for data types where a data type is defined by its behavior
   from the point of view of the user of the data in terms of values and operations.

2. Explain the difference between a queue (FIFO) and a stack (LIFO).
   
   In a queue, elements are entered to the last position in the queue, but removal
   of the elements is done from the first position in the queue. On the other hand,
   in a stack, elements are added to the last position and removal is also done from
   the last position.

3. Name and briefly explain three types of data structures.

   Linked List: An ordered sequence of values where each element contains data and a 
   pointer to the next element.
   Stack: A data type which uses the last in, first out method to push elements to the collection
   and pop which removes the last element that was added.
   Queue: A data type which utilizes the first in, first out method where the first element pushed
   into the collection is also the first element to be popped out.

4. Explain what a binary tree is, what are some common operations of a binary tree?

   A binary tree is a heirarchical tree structure which has at most two children, the left child and the
   the right child. Some common operations of a binary tree is inserting nodes, deleting nodes and traversing
   the tree.

5. Explain what a hash table (dictionary) is, what are common operations of a hash table?

   A hash table is a data structure which is similar to an array, however it has keys that map to values.
   Common operations for the hash table include adding elements to the table and finding elements using 
   their unique keys.
